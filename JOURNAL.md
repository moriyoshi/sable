# Sable — work journal

A development log of the project and the findings behind it, in roughly the order
work happened. The recent session (productionization onward) is first-hand; the
earlier milestones are reconstructed from persistent memory, the README, and the
original design plan.

All build variants stay green throughout: default `-race`, `sable_safe`,
`sable_portable`, `sable_http`, `sable_rust2go`, plus `abi-check`, `loom`, `fuzz`.

## The idea (context)

Fuse a Rust **tokio** runtime with Go's **M:N (GMP)** scheduler into **one shared
OS event loop**, with **symmetric mutual await**: a goroutine can `await` a Rust
async result and a tokio task can `await` a Go result, each without a blocked OS
thread and without busy-polling. No prior work fuses these two at the scheduler
level (rust2go keeps two reactors; UniFFI polls from the foreign side but tokio
still runs its own reactor; go-lib reimplements GMP in Rust).

**The enabling trick.** Stock tokio hides its `mio` epoll and offers no manual
reactor turn, so instead of forking tokio, Sable **removes tokio's reactor**: the
runtime is `new_current_thread().enable_time()` with **no `enable_io()`**, driven
by one executor thread doing `block_on`. With no IO driver tokio owns **zero
epoll** (parks on a futex); **Go's netpoll becomes the only epoll in the process**
(asserted by `TestSingleEpoll` scanning `/proc/self/fd`). tokio still provides its
scheduler, `Waker`, `spawn`, and combinators.

**The correctness lynchpin (shaped everything below).** `gopark`/`goready` are
legal only on a real Go M. The Rust executor thread is a raw pthread — it must
**never** call `goready`. So Rust→Go completions only `write()` an eventfd owned
by Go's netpoll; the actual `goready` happens inside the Go **dispatcher
goroutine** (a real M). Go→Rust crossings ride cgo/asm, where Go always has a
valid `g`/`M`.

# Part I — Foundation: the core fusion PoC (milestones M0–M5)

Built as reversible build-flag layers over a correct baseline; each layer had to
pass the identical stress matrix before the next was enabled.

- **M0 — Skeleton + build harness.** cargo staticlib + cgo + hand-written
  `include/sable.h` → one static binary; `sable_add` round-trips the FFI
  (`TestBuildRoundTrip`).
- **M1 — Symmetric mutual await, stock APIs only** (eventfd bridge, *two*
  epolls). Locked in the semantics, the FFI ownership model, and the
  lost-wakeup-free handshake before any linkname: tokio `AsyncFd<eventfd>` (its
  own mio) ⇄ Go `os.NewFile`/netpoll on an eventfd. 10k-concurrent stress with
  zero lost/duplicate wakeups — the semantic ground truth every later layer keeps
  green.
- **M2 — Single shared epoll** (`//go:linkname poll_runtime_poll*` + pump
  goroutines). Rebuilt tokio IO-disabled → no mio epoll. A `GoPolled` future +
  `sable_go_poll_start` + a per-fd **pump goroutine** looping
  `pollReset → pollWait → fdReady` sources all readiness from Go's netpoll.
  `TestSingleEpoll` asserts exactly one `[eventpoll]` fd. Encoded the
  **edge-triggered drain contract** (drain to `EAGAIN` before re-arming).
- **M3 — Direct park/unpark of awaiters** (`//go:linkname gopark`/`goready`).
  Replaced per-await eventfds with ONE shared completion eventfd + a dispatcher
  goroutine + a `park.go` await-slot state machine (CAS `IDLE→PARKED` in gopark's
  `unlockf` vs `Xchg→READY`+`goready` on deliver), lost-wakeup-safe.
- **M4 — Fast hot crossing** (`//go:linkname runtime.asmcgocall`). The hottest
  crossing (`sable_fd_ready`, fired per readiness event) calls `asmcgocall`
  directly, **skipping `entersyscall`/`exitsyscall`** (two P-state transitions +
  a P re-acquire). Sound only because it is short, non-blocking, non-allocating,
  and never re-enters Go. Build-tag gated with a plain-cgo fallback
  (`-tags sable_safe`).
- **M5 — Guard rails.** sysmon-retake stress, teardown, GC-vs-parked-state, and
  single-epoll-under-load tests.

### Results / findings (M-series, linux/arm64, Go 1.26.4)

- **Single epoll:** exactly one `anon_inode:[eventpoll]` fd in the process.
- **Hot crossing** (`fdReady`): asmcgocall **~7.5 ns/op** vs full cgo **~34 ns/op**
  (~4.5× — the saved `entersyscall`/`exitsyscall` + P re-acquire).
- Correct under `-race`, `GOGC=1` (aggressive GC vs parked state), and 100k+
  concurrent mutual awaits, with zero fd/goroutine/registry leaks.
- **Arch-neutral:** no hand-written per-arch asm (`asmcgocall` sets up the C ABI
  itself). Execution-verified on **arm64 (native)** and **amd64 (static-musl under
  qemu)** — full suite, single-epoll assertion, and the ~4× fast-path win on both.

### Key hazards navigated (each is a test, see source comments)

- **`goready` from a foreign thread is illegal** → route Rust→Go wakes through an
  eventfd the netpoller owns (`park.go`, `bridge.go`).
- **Edge-triggered lost wakeups:** `pollReset` erases a latched `pdReady`; a write
  before `pollOpen` yields no edge → optimistic initial readiness + read-first
  (`poll.go`, `reactor.rs`).
- **fd-reuse race:** closing a fused fd before its netpoll registration is removed
  lets another task reuse the number → the **pump is the sole fd owner and closes
  it after `pollClose`** (`poll.go`).
- **g0-stack constraints:** gopark's `unlockf` runs on g0 where sync/atomic race
  hooks and pointer write-barriers are invalid → `//go:norace`/`nosplit`/
  `nocheckptr` + `internal/runtime/atomic` + a bare-`uintptr` g pointer (`park.go`).
- **STW vs the fast path:** skipping `entersyscall` leaves the P `_Prunning`, so
  the crossing must stay short/non-blocking; verified under `GOGC=1` gctrace
  (bounded STW).

# Part II — Beyond the core

## goexec — running tokio tasks on Go's Ms

The dedicated executor runs tokio on *one* thread (the throughput ceiling + two
cross-thread wakeup hops). `rust/src/goexec.rs` uses `async-task` to split futures
into `Runnable`s that a pool of **Go worker goroutines (one per P)** polls, so each
task *completes on a Go M* and delivers with a **direct `goready`** — no doorbell,
no dispatcher hop.

**Decisive finding — the wakeup primitive.** A first cut parked workers in a Rust
channel's blocking `recv` (opaque to Go's scheduler) → **91 µs** conc-1 latency.
Parking each worker in Go's **netpoller** on its own per-worker eventfd doorbell
(round-robin, no thundering herd) dropped that to **4.4 µs**: Go's scheduler is
built around netpoll, so wakeups must flow through it. vs the dedicated executor:
latency 12.0 µs → **4.4 µs** (2.7×), CPU-bound 3718 → **1318 ns/op** (2.8×). Clean
under a 2M-await soak. Scope: pure-compute futures, round-robin (not
work-stealing), and it does not carry the single-epoll property.

## Inline fast path (M7)

The gap vs pure tokio was that *every* await used the async
spawn→park→cross-thread-wake→deliver path, paying a wakeup **syscall** even for
futures that never suspend. Fix (`inline.go`, `sable_future_*`): **poll inline on
the goroutine's own M**, go async only on suspension. Fast path polls once with a
no-op waker — if `Ready`, return with no spawn/gopark/syscall; only genuine
`Pending` falls back to the token-keyed waker + gopark (safe: the re-poll
re-checks readiness). **Finding:** inline compute **75 ns/op** — *beats*
pure-tokio spawn+await (~220) and is 22× under the old fusion path (1683);
fallback 4583 (1.6× < the old 7339). The common case now exceeds pure-tokio
parity, leaving ~65 ns of FFI + poll setup.

## Real-world scenario: reqwest + axum (`-tags sable_http`)

Proves the fusion holds with **full tokio-ecosystem apps**: `rust/src/http.rs`
runs **axum** + **reqwest** on a *separate* multi-thread io-enabled runtime
sharing sable's completion delivery (reqwest/axum need `tokio::net`, so this
runtime has its own mio epoll — two epolls in this scenario; the single-epoll
property is specific to the custom `GoAsyncFd` path). A Go goroutine drives a
reqwest GET and parks via `gopark`; the axum `/go` handler calls **back into Go**
(`sable_go_double`), so a request crosses Go → reqwest → axum → Go → back. 200
concurrent, zero errors, `-race`, on arm64 and amd64. The http lib references the
`sable_go_double` export, so it builds into a **separate target dir** and never
clobbers the lean core lib.

## Performance vs pure tokio (the honest cost)

`make bench-pure` runs the identical workloads in pure tokio, so the delta is
exactly the fusion boundary:

| workload | pure tokio | sable | overhead |
|---|---|---|---|
| spawn+await latency (1 in flight) | ~260 ns | ~12 µs | ~46× (two cross-thread handoffs + gopark/goready) |
| spawn+await throughput (saturated) | ~4.5M/s | ~0.83M/s | ~5.4× (~1 µs/op) |
| HTTP req/sec (`/ping`) | ~145k | ~122k | ~1.2× (~16 %) |

Takeaway: latency and trivial-compute throughput pay a real price (two
cross-thread wakeups per await), but **real I/O-bound work barely notices** — the
fusion is a poor fit for chatty nanosecond calls and a fine fit for the async I/O
that async runtimes exist for. Raw mutual-await throughput saturates by ~64
concurrent goroutines and stays flat (~800k/sec) through 32,768; a 3M-await soak
returns fds/goroutines/registries to baseline with no leaks.

# Part III — Productionization roadmap (R1–R6, under a self-paced `/loop`)

Ran as a loop, one tested chunk per iteration, each verified under default
`-race` + portable + `make abi-check` before being marked done. Two
roadmap-added tools later caught real bugs in *other* items (see R6b, R6c).

### R1 — CI matrix + `verify-all`
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make verify-all` (abi-check + suite + safe
variant + pipe-doorbell + http) across the certified Go × arch matrix, plus a
Go-tip tripwire job (allowed to fail) as early warning for the next release.

### R2 — Portable fallback (zero-linkname channel backend)
`make portable` / `-tags sable_portable` against the Rust core lib
(`--no-default-features`): a channel-based await backend with **zero
`//go:linkname` and zero asm** that works on any toolchain — the insurance for an
uncertified/future Go release, trading away the single-epoll pump, goexec, and
inline paths for durability.

### R3 — Generic byte-buffer `Call` API
`Call(op, req []byte) ([]byte, error)` (`call.go`) awaits an **arbitrary Rust
async op**, marshalling request/response as byte buffers (caller serializes its
own types). Explicit ownership contract: the result is a Rust-owned buffer Go
copies out (`C.GoBytes`) then frees (`sable_call_free`) — single owner, single
free. It is **core** (spawn + doorbell only), so it works under both the fast and
the portable backends. Verified under `-race` incl. 1k concurrent unique payloads.

### R4 — Cancellation
`CallCtx(ctx, op, req)`: a watcher goroutine calls `sable_call_cancel` when `ctx`
is cancelled, which aborts the tokio task (`AbortHandle::abort`), dropping its
future so `Drop` runs. **Key design:** a **publish-on-drop `CancelGuard` captured
*by* the future** guarantees exactly one completion (the real result on normal
finish, or a cancellation sentinel) even for a never-polled abort — no
double-wakeup, no orphaned result buffer, no registry leak. Verified: 500
concurrent cancels drain to 0 pending; a 10s op cancels in ~50 ms with
`context.Canceled`.

### R5 — Verification tooling (Loom · fuzz · Miri)
Added `make loom` / `make fuzz` / `make miri` and the concurrency/memory-safety
cores:
- **Loom** (`rust/tests/loom_wakeup.rs`) exhaustively model-checks the await-slot
  park/deliver protocol (`parkCommit` `CAS(IDLE→PARKED)` vs `deliverCompletion`
  `Xchg(→READY)`+`goready`): committed park ⟹ goready exactly once; aborted park ⟹
  no goready. **Finding:** the *first* model (waker + mutex + fired-flag) reported
  a "lost wakeup" — the **model** was buggy, not the protocol; rewritten to the
  await-slot pure-atomic CAS model that mirrors `park.go`, which passes.
- **Go fuzzing** (`FuzzCall`) drives arbitrary `(op, bytes)` through the `Call`
  FFI. **Finding:** it failed on byte `0xeb` — the *test oracle* used Go's UTF-8
  `bytes.ToUpper` while the Rust op does byte-wise `to_ascii_uppercase`; fixed the
  oracle, then 3.1M+ execs clean. (Library correct; test wrong.)
- **Miri** (nightly) UB-checks the `Call` pointer lifecycle; **Rust TSan** runs
  separately from Go's TSan (two TSan runtimes in one process are unstable).

### R6a — Observability
Atomic counters on `Inner` (`n_spawned`, `n_completed`, `n_cancelled`,
`peak_queue`, `in_flight`, `max_in_flight`, `n_rejected`) surfaced as
`RuntimeStats() Stats` via `sable_stats`. `InFlight` and `PeakQueueDepth` are the
producer-outpacing-consumer signals that motivated R6b. Core surface (both
backends).

### R6b — Backpressure
`SetMaxInFlight(n)` + `TryCall` returning `ErrBackpressure` immediately at
capacity (nothing spawned, nothing parked); admission is a lock-free CAS on the
`in_flight` gauge (`awaitViaParkTry` skips the park on refusal).
**Bug found & fixed (caught by R6a's `TestStats`):** the shared `publish`
decremented `in_flight` on *every* completion, but the inline/http paths publish
**without** admitting → the gauge underflowed
(`in_flight ... = 18446744073709549841`). Fixed by splitting **`publish`** (pure
transport: enqueue + peak + ring) from **`complete`** (accounting: `note_complete`
+ publish), and routing only admitted completions through `complete`.
`TestBackpressure`: 300 simultaneous callers, cap 4, gauge never peaks above 4.

### R6c — Graceful shutdown
`Shutdown()` orders teardown to close two hazards:
- **Use-after-free of `rt`**: the dispatcher dereferences the global `rt` in
  `drainCompletions`, so freeing the box while it runs is UAF. Order:
  `sable_runtime_shutdown` (abort in-flight + join executor, box stays valid) →
  close the doorbell so the dispatcher drains once more and exits → **then**
  `sable_runtime_free`.
- **eventfd leak / double-close**: `Inner` had no `Drop` (every runtime leaked its
  eventfd). Now Rust owns and closes it on drop, and Go polls a `syscall.Dup` of
  it — each side closes its own descriptor.
`TestTeardownNoLeak` (100 runtimes with tasks in flight) + `TestShutdownAndReinit`.

### R6d — Platform abstraction (the doorbell)
The one genuinely OS-specific piece, the Rust→Go completion doorbell, was
abstracted in `rust/src/doorbell.rs`: **eventfd** on Linux, **self-pipe** on
macOS/BSD (`SABLE_PIPE_DOORBELL=1` forces the self-pipe on Linux for testing —
`make test-pipe`). The doorbell carries no payload (the `(token, result)` rides
the queue), so the Go dispatcher is primitive-agnostic. netpoll linknames are
OS-agnostic at the source level.

**Roadmap infra also added:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gained `verification`
(loom+fuzz), `miri` (nightly, allowed-to-fail), and later the `rust2go` job.

---

# Part IV — rust2go integration

## A rust2go-style example (imitation)

*"Write an example that exhibits the use with rust2go."* Hand-wrote the rust2go
**calling pattern** over Sable's generic `Call` (zero extra deps): typed request
struct + flat codec + a typed entry point awaiting an async Rust handler (op 10),
so the call site looks like rust2go's while the async work runs on Sable's fused
runtime. Documented in `examples/rust2go.md` with the architectural contrast
(rust2go = two reactors; Sable = one shared epoll).

## Actually wiring the real rust2go crate

*"Actually wire rust2go."* Replaced the imitation with a genuine integration of
the real `rust2go` crate, behind `--features rust2go` / `-tags sable_rust2go` and
its own cargo target dir.

**Key finding — the fit is structural.** rust2go's `g2r` (Go-calls-Rust) is
**sync-only**; its codegen literally errors on an `async fn` with *"manually spawn
by your own."* That is exactly Sable's role. So: **rust2go owns the typed request
crossing** (`#[derive(R2G)]` marshalling, `#[rust2go::g2r]` C export + Go binding,
its own g0-stack `cgocall` shim); **Sable owns the async + completion** (the g2r
handler `spawn`s onto Sable's IO-disabled tokio and delivers the result via the
completion doorbell on the await token). The response rides Sable's byte-buffer
`CallResult` (g2r's sync return can't carry an async result).

**Findings / fixes:**
- The crossing panicked on Go's cgo pointer-pinning check; rust2go's own README/CI
  **require `GODEBUG=cgocheck=0,invalidptr=0`** (it passes Go pointers through ref
  structs). `//go:debug` was **rejected** ("unknown //go:debug setting" — not in
  the allowlist); GODEBUG must be an env var set at process start, so the Makefile
  `run-/test-rust2go` targets set it.
- The generated Go binding's `DemoUser` clashed with the imitation's `DemoUser`;
  resolved by renaming the Rust struct (later renamed again — see Part V demo swap).
- The generated binding is **committed**, so build/test needs only the crate + Go
  module (no `rust2go-cli`); `make gen-rust2go` regenerates and re-prepends the
  `//go:build sable_rust2go` tag the cli omits.

---

# Part V — Publish-ready (recent session)

## Restructure into an importable library

*"To make this PoC publish-ready, separate example/benchmarking code from the
library core."* Turned a single `package main` in `go/` into an importable Go
library with examples/benchmarks split out.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `go/*.go` (`package main`) | **repo root = `package sable`**, `github.com/moriyoshi/sable` |
| `go/main.go` | `cmd/sable-demo/` (builds `./sable`) |
| `go/rust2go.go` | `examples/rust2go/` (pure Go over `sable.Call`) |
| `go/r2g*.go` | `examples/rust2go-real/` (real crate, `-tags sable_rust2go`) |
| `go/http*.go` | `examples/http/` (reqwest+axum, `-tags sable_http`) |
| `go/bench_*_test.go` | `bench/` (public-API microbenchmarks) |
| demo op handlers in `rust/src/lib.rs` | `rust/src/demo.rs` (module split) |

**Public API added** (`api.go`/`api_fast.go`/`api_asm.go`/`call.go`): `Init`
(idempotent `sync.Once`; every entry point calls it lazily), `AwaitRust`,
`AwaitToken(spawn)→uint64`, `AwaitCallResult(spawn)→[]byte`, `RuntimePtr()→uintptr`,
`CountEpollFds`, `RustAwaitsGo`, `ReadPipeViaRust`, `CrossingCgo`, `CrossingAsm`.

**Key finding — why `RuntimePtr` + `AwaitToken`/`AwaitCallResult` exist.** cgo
types are **package-scoped**: an example package cannot see the library's
`C.SableRuntime`, so it can't call the shared runtime's cgo functions directly.
The advanced examples (http, rust2go-real) take the runtime as a `uintptr`
(`RuntimePtr`) and cast it in their own cgo, and park/deliver through the public
`AwaitToken` (raw u64) / `AwaitCallResult` (byte-buffer) primitives. This is the
crux that made a clean library boundary possible.

**Other decisions / findings:**
- Demo ops moved to `rust/src/demo.rs` as a **module split, not a feature gate** —
  a `demo` feature would force `--features demo` onto every build variant and risk
  one missing it.
- Public-API benchmarks → external `bench/`; benchmarks over unexported internals
  (inline/goexec/stress) stay in-package (`_test.go` can't `import "C"`, and you
  can't bench unexported symbols externally).
- Opt-in examples each have a tagged real file + a `!tag` `stub.go` so plain
  `go build ./...` compiles without the special libs.
- `TestMain`s route through `Init()` (the `Once`) so the lazy `Init()` never
  double-builds; `shutdown_test.go` keeps raw `sableInit()` for its
  shutdown→reinit cycle.

**Bug found & fixed:** `make test-pipe` returned `(cached)` —
`SABLE_PIPE_DOORBELL` is read by Rust at process start and does **not** key Go's
test cache, so it reused the eventfd result and never exercised the self-pipe.
Added `-count=1` (pre-existing latent bug).

**Also:** `.gitignore` (binaries + `rust/target*`); Makefile/CI paths →
`./...`, `.`, `./cmd/sable-demo`, `./examples/*`; README Layout + "use as a
library" sections.

## Consolidated the three docs into README.md

Deleted `PLATFORMS.md`, `SUPPORTED.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`; folded their full
content into self-contained README sections — **Verification**,
**Supported Go toolchains**, **Operating-system support**. Repointed the four
references in files that stay (`shutdown_test.go`, `rust/src/doorbell.rs`, two CI
comments). **Gotcha:** a `sed` repoint injected nested double-quotes into a Go
string literal in `shutdown_test.go`, breaking the build; fixed by dropping the
inner quotes.

## Replaced the age-verification demo

*"Age verification example is inappropriate. Replace it with something."* The
`check_user` / `DemoUser{name, age}` / `age >= 18` / "welcome"/"must be 18" demo
became an **inventory stock check**: `Order{item, qty}` → `qty <= 20` (20 on hand)
→ "`item` reserved" / "only 20 `item` in stock". Same typed-request →
async-lookup → typed-reply shape and the same straddles-a-boundary concurrency
test. Touched `rust/src/demo.rs` (`check_stock`), `rust/src/r2g.rs`
(`Order{item, qty}`), the **regenerated** `examples/rust2go-real/r2g_gen.go` (via
`make gen-rust2go`, so the rename cascaded instead of being hand-edited), both
examples' Go + tests, `examples/rust2go.md`, and the README. `make run-rust2go`
now prints `CheckStockReal(widgets) -> ok=true message=widgets reserved` and
`(gizmos) -> ok=false message=only 20 gizmos in stock`.

## Rendered the README ASCII diagrams in Mermaid

The boxes-and-arrows **architecture** figure and the **Layout** brace grouping
became GitHub-native ```mermaid``` `flowchart` blocks (Layout keeps a plain-text
file index below its structure diagram). No box-drawing art remains in README.

## This journal

Written, then expanded to cover the whole project — from the M0–M5 foundation and
the goexec/inline/http explorations through the R1–R6 roadmap, rust2go, and the
publish-ready work.

## The embedding surface (S-1..S-5) — zero-copy binding support

`../imbh-go/docs/prescription-sable.md` asked sable to become **hostable** by an
out-of-tree crate (a zero-copy Arrow / DataFusion binding) instead of only
running its own demo ops. Five items, all **additive** — no change to the
doorbell, the park/deliver state machine, the dispatcher, or the single-epoll
invariant — now merged to `main` (commits `cda38a3` S-1/S-2/S-5, `433869b`
S-4.2, `44c067b` S-3, `f08bd91` docs; branch `zero-copy-binding-phase1` deleted).

- **S-1 — pluggable handler registry** (`rust/src/registry.rs`).
  `sable::register(op, handler)` lets a depending crate host `op -> async handler`
  before `Init`, so the byte-buffer Call path is no longer hardwired to the demo
  ops. A shared `dispatch()` backs `sable_call`/`_try`/`_ctx`: **registry first,
  demo fallback second**. A blanket `AsyncHandler` impl makes the common case a
  plain closure; the table is a `LazyLock<Mutex<HashMap>>` read as a cloned `Arc`
  per Call so **the lock is never held across `.await`**.

- **S-2 — opaque handle (zero copy).** A handler may return `Payload::Handle{ptr,
  release}` instead of `Payload::Bytes`. sable delivers `ptr` as the ordinary
  `(token, u64)` completion — **it never inspects the pointer** — and Go takes
  ownership via `sable_call_handle` / `CallHandle`. The safety net mirrors
  `CancelGuard`: a `token -> release` map is armed *before* delivery and swept on
  shutdown, so a handle Go never takes (shutdown/abort/never-taken) gets
  `release(ptr)` driven **exactly once**. `sable_call_handle_taken` disarms it on
  the happy path. `0` is the reserved "no handle" sentinel on the wire
  (`ErrNoHandle`).

- **S-3 — streaming cursor.** A stream op yields many batches lazily without
  materializing the whole result and **without `block_on`**. The model:
  "async get_next" = a **bounded mpsc**. `register_stream(op, |req, tx| async…)`
  is a *producer* that pushes each batch (a `Payload`) into `tx`; returning ends
  the stream. `sable_stream_open` runs the producer + registers a cursor;
  `sable_stream_next` awaits **one** batch and completes the token with its handle
  (`0` = end-of-stream) — each Next is a fresh single completion, the goroutine
  parks, **no M blocked**; `sable_stream_close` aborts the producer (dropping the
  pinned stream, e.g. releasing a DataFusion snapshot) and drains buffers.
  Per-batch handles reuse the S-2 release net. The **bounded channel IS the
  backpressure** — the producer awaits capacity, and a dropped receiver makes the
  next `send` fail so the producer stops cleanly. Go glue: `Stream` / `OpenStream`
  / `Next` / `Close`. Cursors are also swept on shutdown (`drain_cursors`).

- **S-4.2 — multi-thread executor keeps the single epoll.** For CPU-heavy
  handlers (DataFusion) that need real parallelism, an opt-in `multithread`
  feature adds `new_multithread` = an **IO-disabled** `new_multi_thread()
  .enable_time()` executor. **Empirically validated** (`make test-multithread`,
  `lib.rs s4_epoll_tests`): multi-thread + `enable_time` (no `enable_io`) → **0
  epoll**; `enable_all()` + a bound socket → **≥1** (control). This proves the
  epoll is **IO-driver-sourced, not scheduler-sourced** — the same trick that made
  the current-thread runtime own zero epoll holds for the multi-thread one. `new()`
  and `new_multithread()` share wiring via `from_tokio()`; the symbol is absent
  from the default `libsable.a`.

- **S-5 — the embedder owns the lib.** `crate-type += rlib`; a `demo` feature
  (default-on) gates every demo op; cgo LDFLAGS split into `link_default.go` /
  `link_extern.go` so `-tags sable_extern_lib` lets the binding supply a combined
  staticlib via `CGO_LDFLAGS`. Verified by linking `cmd/sable-demo` against a
  **no-demo core**.

**Key finding — one completion primitive carries everything.** Bytes, opaque
handles, and per-batch stream items all ride the *same* `(token, u64)` doorbell
completion the original design shipped; S-2/S-3 add no new transport, only new
*interpretations* of the `u64` (a result length vs. a raw pointer vs. a cursor
id / end sentinel). The zero-copy path is "free" precisely because the doorbell
never dereferences what it delivers.

**Key finding — release-on-drop generalizes.** The exactly-once cleanup net first
built for `CancelGuard` (R4) turned out to be the right shape for *any* resource
handed across the boundary: opaque handles (S-2) and open cursors (S-3) both
arm a release/abort keyed by token, swept on the same shutdown path. New
ownership, zero new lifecycle machinery.

**Scope boundary.** The remaining pieces belong to imbh-go, not sable: the actual
Arrow FFI export inside handlers, S-4.1 `spawn_blocking` wrapping (binding-side),
and wiring Go's `Init` to select the multi-thread runtime. sable ships the
*surface*; the binding brings the engine. This also partly retires the standing
follow-up "a user-populated dispatch registry replacing the demo ops" — the
registry now exists (S-1); the demo ops remain only as the fallback.

**Docs.** `f08bd91` folded all of this into the README — a new **Embedding**
section, an **Ownership & lifetimes across the boundary** section (per-transport
object/blob ownership across the FFI), and the `demo`/`multithread`/
`sable_extern_lib` build knobs. Tests: registry bytes/handle + byte-path
misuse-release (Rust); `CallHandle` end-to-end zero-copy read+release, stream
full-drain / early-close-cancel / unknown-op (Go, `-race`) — green under both the
fast and portable backends.

## Standing project facts

- `go.mod` pins `toolchain go1.26.4`; **any Go upgrade is an ABI re-audit**. The
  linknamed seams are certified per-version by `make abi-check` (guard fails
  closed; override `SABLE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_GO=1` only to certify).
- `go.mod`'s `github.com/ihciah/rust2go` require is used **only** under
  `-tags sable_rust2go`, so `go mod tidy` must run with that tag or it drops the
  line.
- Building the core Rust lib (`--no-default-features`) to the **default** target
  dir clobbers the fast `libsable.a`; portable/http/rust2go builds each use a
  separate `--target-dir`.
- `go vet ./...` reports three `possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer` notes in
  `park.go`/`trampoline.go` — intentional `unsafe.Pointer(uintptr)` on the
  gopark/asmcgocall glue, guarded by `//go:nocheckptr`; `go test`'s vet subset
  does not flag them.
- **Open follow-ups (not blocking):** macOS certification on real hardware;
  Windows IOCP doorbell handle; non-Linux `/proc` guards for the fast-only
  stress/robust suites; inline under `Handle::enter()` (M8) + pooled waker
  registry (M9); a user-populated dispatch registry replacing the demo ops.
